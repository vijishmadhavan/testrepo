## Docker

### Build
```
docker build -t testapp1:latest .
```

### Run
```
docker run -p 8501:8501 testapp1:latest
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8501 for the app. (Streamlit runs on port 8501 by default)

## Technical details
- U-Net allows us to look at pixel-wise representations of our images through sizing it down and then blowing it bck up into a high resolution image. The first part we call an "encoder" and the second a "decoder"
-  U-Net learner with a Residual Neural Network (ResNet) backbone and then trigger the fast.ai training process,We have used resnet 34.


## Installation Details
